For any further information on the coverage of the deposit, please refer to the Terms and Conditions of Hire of your country of rental, by clicking here and selecting your country of rental.

            The amount of the Deposit stays valid for the length of the rental agreement period. For rental agreements longer than thirty (30) days, a new authorization for each additional period of rental will be requested by AFRICARS from the card holder's bank account.
